# FIREBASE

Firebase is a platform developed by Google that provides a set of tools and services for building and managing web and mobile applications. It offers features like databases, **authentication**, cloud storage, hosting, and more. Firebase simplifies the development process by handling backend infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building the frontend and user experience of their applications. It's commonly used for developing applications that require real-time updates, user authentication, and cloud-based storage.
